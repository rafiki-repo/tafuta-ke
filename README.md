## Executive Summary

Tafuta is a super simple low cost business directory with single page website hosting. It will be rolled out in Kenya and serve the low-end of the market.  It also provides user and business identity management. It includes authentication, a payment hub, alerts/reminders and a config panel for customers to manage their own content.

"I would rather make no money and create 10,000 jobs than make a boat load of money and have the economy continue to struggle." So please build me a platform that empowers businesses and creates jobs.
