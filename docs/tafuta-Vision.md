# Tafuta - Vision
Tafuta on the surface is a basic business directory and web hosting company tailored for businesses in Kenya. However, underneath the hood it is so much more.

Our mission is to grow businesses in Kenya and end unemployment.

## Core Vision
- In a country where there is very little access to marketing for small businesses, Tafuta is a platform that empowers businesses, even small businesses, to get noticed. It is a way to even the playing field for businesses and provide opportunity for those who otherwise would not have it. 
- It is an opportunity for Young Adults that have a entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to work hard to become the connector between businesses and the Tafuta marketing platform. An economic engine for the average Kenyan (just like Uber offers an economic engine for the average driver).
- It is a front-door of introduction to business leaders in Kenya. If we are going to solve unemployment in Kenya, we need to connect with business leaders and help them grow their businesses. Tafuta gives us that opportunity by offering something they need at a super low price (or in some cases for free)
- In a country where 60% of the population is living in poverty, Tafuta is a platform that empowers businesses to thrive in the digital economy.

## HOW IT WILL WORK
- Businesses will be able to sign-up on their own or through the help of a marketing agent.
- Information the business provides in a single config panel will be used across all Tafuta promotions: business listing, 1-page website, ads, etc.
- A business listing is free, but businesses will pay for ads or a 1-page website. Cost of these will be low to make it accessible to small businesses.
- Businesses can receive discounts and free services if they meet certain criteria. For example, businesses that are employing 5+ employees or are verified to be paying all of their employees a minimum wage. This will encourage companies to grow beyond "a few family members" or to stop underpaying their employees.
- Users will be able to install the PWA on their cell phone as an icon or get to the website easily; tafuta.ke
- Users can quickly search for a specific business or more importantly visit category pages that will help them explore businesses in their area; salons, restaurants, hardware stores, grocery stores (or food vendors), etc.
- Users can easily switch to a language of their choice.
- In the future they will be able to mark their favorites and share their favorites with their friends.
- In the future they will be able to see special events and discounts for businesses they are interested in.
- In the future they will be able to find local market places and see what special events are happening in their area.
- In the future they will be able to contact the business owner through whatsapp to ask questions such as "do you have any maize?"
- In the future they can jump to a similar app and find a driver to pick them up and take them to the market.

## HOW IT WILL HELP SOLVE UNEMPLOYMENT
- Locals can sign-up to market the platform - they will visit businesses and offer to help them get listed for free. If the business wants to register themselves, there is no cost. If the business wants the agent to help them, the agent can charge a small fee for their services. Services can include gathering data and geo-data, entering data, taking/cleaning-up a photo, language translation, managing the business listing, etc.
- Tafuta marketing/account agents can offer updates and upgrades such as placing an ad on the website, setting up a 1-page website, or becoming a verified business. They can also offer other services with other platforms such as getting listed on Google My Business, etc. They can build strong relationships with business leaders and better understand how businesses succeed.
- Tafuta can run special campaigns to generate revenue and further promote businesses. Marketing agents can help build awareness within their communities and among their clients (businesses they help manage in Tafuta).
- Tafuta can partner with other marketing companies to further promote their clients and think of innovative ways to grow their business.
- Tafuta can run training sessions to help the marketing agents grow their skills in marketing and business and other relevant work related disciplines. 
- Tafuta can leverage the relationship with the business owners to better understand economic barriers, brainstorm solutions to unemployment, carry out projects to increase the number of jobs, offer trainings and supports, etc.

NOTE!!!
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THIS APP TAILORS TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF SUBURBAN REGIONS IN KENYA AND RURAL REGIONS IN KENYA ONLY. It should not tailor to urban regions in Kenya nor other countries. It should address the needs and small nuances of the local population making this app unique and valuable to the local economy. It must be simple, fun, and build trust.

"I would rather make no money and create 10,000 jobs than make a boat load of money and have the economy continue to struggle." So please build me a platform that empowers businesses and creates jobs.
